          <p class="text">The barreleye, also know as the spook fish, is a small deap sea fish found in the tropical waters of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans
            <br> 
            They are named after their barrel-shaped, tubular eyes, which usually detect prey directly over them.
            <br>
            Suprisingly, they have toothless mouths that are very small. The best part about these fishes is their transparent look, they don't actually have transparent skin just luminous organs.
          <br>
            They swim from 400 to 2500m deep. There fins are spinless and fairly small but their pectoral ones can extend to about half it's body length.
