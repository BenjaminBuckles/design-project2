          <p class="text"> The anglerfish are very bony fish. They are named after their charecteristic mode of predation, in which their fin ray acts as a lure for other fish.
            <br> 
            Some are pelagic(swimming away from the sea floor), while others are benthic(swimming close to the sea floor).
            <br>
            Angler fishes look prehistoric because they are. These fish were around over 130 million years.
          <br>
            All anglerfish are carnivorous and are adapted for the capture of prey. Their teeth are their most prized possesion which help them with prey grabbing.
