        <p class="text">The sawfish, also know as the carpenter shark, are characterized by their long and narrow nose, lined with sharp teeths.
          <br> 
          They are amongst the largest fish species growing up to 7.6 meters. They are usually found in tropical regions in coastal waters, as well as rivers and lakes. 
          <br>
          Sadly, all of these species are endangered and rapidly declining in population. The few remaining are in Northen Australia and the United States.
        <br>
          Sawfish are predators and eat on small fish like crustatians. Some people think they attack big animals like whales and dolphins but nothing is proven.
